# Migrating to Haruto's GraphTool version of CrinGraph for existing users of Squig.link

## Steps

1. Drag and drop your data folder over, overwriting the existing data folder.
2. (RECOMMENDED BUT OPTIONAL) Separate targets in your data folder to a separate folder named "targets" for each data folders.
3. Make changes to `config.js` and `config_hp.js` as necessary, should just be copy pastes from your old files as I've standardized the naming.
4. Make changes to `index.html` (your IEM page), and `index_hp.html` (your headphones page) as necessary, make sure to not touch anything outside the `<head>` tag.
5. Deploy and enjoy your new functionalities!
